First of all, you need have the docker installed in your machine (https://www.docker.com/).
Then, choose one of these two ways to run the project with docker.

* Run with docker-compose (Recommended!):
    docker-compose up

* Run building and running the image:
build image (first step): docker build -t maoonchain-image .
run container (last step): docker run --name cont --rm -p 3000:3000 maoonchain-image

After, you have to browse to http://localhost:3000/ and you are good to go!
